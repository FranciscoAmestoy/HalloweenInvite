# Halloween Invite RPG Demo 🎃

A small **Halloween-themed RPG demo** made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
Originally designed as an interactive **invitation to a Halloween party** for friends.  

This was a **learning project**, exploring how to build a simple RPG with exploration, combat, and atmosphere.  
It is no longer under development, but remains available as a demo.
