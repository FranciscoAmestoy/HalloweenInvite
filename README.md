# \# 🎃 Halloween Invite RPG Demo

# 

# This is a \*\*demo project\*\* created to learn how to use \[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) by building a small \*\*Halloween-themed RPG\*\*.  

# It was designed as a fun, interactive \*\*invitation to a Halloween party\*\* for my friends. 🕸️

#

# \## 🐞 Known Bugs

# 

# \- 🔸 Sometimes colliding with props causes the player to get stuck.  

# &nbsp; 👉 Workaround: Press \*\*Alt + F4\*\* and restart.

# \- 🔸 AI movement is erratic.  

# &nbsp; 👉 Not fixed because it turned out to be \*hilarious as-is\*.

# \- 🔸 No game-over screen.  

# &nbsp; 👉 Missing on purpose, since this is only a demo.
